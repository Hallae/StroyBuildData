Data was taken from a json file and made into dispayable information for a user.


EG.

HTML table from a JSON object containing data about total chats over a specific period. This functionality is implemented using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and ASP.NET Razor syntax. 
The JSON object includes details such as the name of the report, request parameters like distribution and filters, total number of chats, and records with dates and their corresponding total chats.

The JavaScript function convertToTable is responsible for creating the HTML table. It starts by selecting a container element (tableContainer) where the table will be inserted. Then, it creates a new table element, appends a table header (thead) with two columns for "Date" and "Total Chats", and a table body (tbody) where it iterates over the JSON data to create rows for each date and total chats. Finally, it appends the newly created table to the container.


Then css was added to style the tables.


This approach allows for the dynamic generation of an HTML table directly from JSON data, which can be particularly useful in web applications where data may be fetched asynchronously from a server and needs to be displayed in a tabular format without requiring a full page reload.
